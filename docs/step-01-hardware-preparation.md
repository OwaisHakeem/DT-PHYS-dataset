Step 1 — Hardware Identification and Initial Preparation Aim To identify and prepare the hardware components required for physiological data acquisition using the e-Health Sensor Platform prior to software configuration.



Hardware Used

Arduino Uno (ATmega328P)

e-Health Sensor Platform v2.0 (Cooking Hacks / Libelium)

USB Type-B cable

Personal computer (Windows OS)



Actions Performed

Verified the version of the e-Health Sensor Platform (v2.0) via PCB labelling.

Connected the Arduino Uno to the computer via USB cable.

Confirmed Arduino Uno detection in the operating system (COM port identification).

Ensured no sensors were connected during initial setup to avoid power or driver conflicts.



Outcome

The Arduino Uno was successfully detected by the operating system and powered correctly, confirming readiness for software configuration.
